Project: Machine Learning for Sub-typing Parkinson's Disease
Name: Harshvardhan Singh

-------

## Provide a brief description of the project
_Kelsey is working on an amazing but a challenging project. And it is quite inspiring to see that she is willing to achieve her goals on it all by herself. The project is to tain a machine learning model which sub-types Parkinson's disease. In order to do so, she is using cluster analysis to see if there are non-motor symptoms or brain pathology. And if she finds that there are clusters that appear to suggest either non-motor symptoms or brain pathology, she would use regression and regress the biomarker data onto these clusters by using them as predictors for the sub-typing_

## What changes would you recommend?
_Replace with your answer_
1. For challenges that you are facing during your data wrangling process and removing certain unwanted data, I would suggest that you could do it keeping the desired output in mind. It helps when you are unsure of what data you need to get rid of.
2. I would like to know what methods you would be using to measure the performance of the cluster model and the decision tree. I would suggest that you could use confusion matrix in order to do so, and there are also other interesting matrices like purity and rand index
